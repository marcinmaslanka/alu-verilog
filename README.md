## üî¢ 16-Bit ALU in Verilog
This project implements a simple 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog. It performs addition and generates condition flags such as Sign, Zero, Carry, Parity, and Overflow.

## üìÅ Files

File Name	Description
alu.v	Verilog source code for the 16-bit ALU, composed of chained 4-bit adders.
alu_tb.v	Testbench for simulating and verifying the ALU behavior.
alu_tb.vcd	Output waveform file generated by the testbench, viewable with GTKWave.

## üß† Module Structure

The ALU is composed of:
### alu
- Four adder4 modules (each made of fulladder blocks).

- Logic to compute condition flags:

        -Sign: MSB of result (z[15])

        -Zero: Set if all bits in result are 0

        -Carry: Final carry-out of the addition

        -Parity: Even parity of the result

        -Overflow: Signed overflow detection

### adder4
Chain of four fulladder instances for 4-bit addition with carry propagation.

### fulladder
Gate-level implementation using XOR, AND, and OR gates for single-bit full addition.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Simulation Instructions
Using Icarus Verilog & GTKWave
Compile the design:

```bash
iverilog -o alu_tb.vvp alu.v alu_tb.v
```

Run the simulation:

```bash
vvp alu_tb.vvp
```

View the waveform (optional):

```bash
gtkwave alu_tb.vcd
```

## üìä Example Test Output
The testbench runs multiple test cases and prints the following information:

```ini

    x=8fff, y=8000, z=0fff | sign=0, zero=0, carry=1, parity=0, overflow=1
    x=fffe, y=0002, z=0000 | sign=0, zero=1, carry=1, parity=1, overflow=0
    x=aaaa, y=5555, z=ffff | sign=1, zero=0, carry=0, parity=1, overflow=0
```

## üß™ Testbench Highlights
Uses $monitor for console-based debug output.

Dumps signals to .vcd file for waveform inspection.

Provides stimulus to trigger edge cases like carry and overflow.
